\section{Task 1}
Question 1
-	COVID and normal chest X-rays can have subtle visual differences, making it hard for a model to learn the differences between classes.
-	The dataset size is relatively small (only 1600 training images), which increases the risk of overfitting.
-	X-ray images often have variability in terms of brightness, contrast, and anatomical differences between individuals, which introduce noise
-	If the dataset is not perfectly balanced the model might become biased toward the majority class but fortunately, the plot shows that this is not the case here.
